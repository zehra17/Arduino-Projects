# Arduino Beginner Projects
This repository contains the projects I created as a beginner in Arduino to develop my basic electronics and programming skills. These projects are small applications focused on fundamental concepts encountered during my learning journey.

## Contents
The projects I have completed so far:

1. **Turning on an LED with a Push Button:** Lighting up an LED when a button is pressed.
2. **Blink Application (LED Blinking):** Making an LED blink at regular intervals.
3. **Analog Reading and Serial Communication:** Reading data from a potentiometer and displaying it via the serial port.
4. **Controlling LED Brightness with PWM and a Potentiometer:** Adjusting LED brightness by turning a potentiometer.
5. **Sequential LED Lighting and Reverse Effect:** Lighting up 6 LEDs sequentially and then in reverse order.
6. **Connecting and Using an RGB LED:** Controlling an RGB LED to display various colors.

Each project includes explanations, codes, and circuit diagrams (if necessary) within the repository.

## My Goal
As a beginner in Arduino, my aims are:

- To understand electronic circuits and components,
- To enhance my programming skills with Arduino,
- To progress from basic to complex projects,
- To document my learning process and inspire others.

## How to Use
To try these projects with your own Arduino kit:

1. Download the relevant project folder.
2. Open it in Arduino IDE or a similar environment.
3. Set up the required circuit and upload the code to run the project.

## Feedback and Contributions
I welcome all feedback! If you find any issues or opportunities for improvement in the projects, feel free to open an Issue. You can also share suggestions for advanced projects or contribute through Pull Requests.

**Note:** This repository represents a basic learning journey. I will continue to add new projects as I progress.
